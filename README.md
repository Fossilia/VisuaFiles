# VisuaFiles
 VisuaFiles scans your files and organizes them in file groups that allows you to easily see
 exactly what type of files make up your drive or directory. VisuaFiles allow you to
 then view the files in each group (in sorted order from biggest size to smallest) and open
 them in file explorer or delete them.
