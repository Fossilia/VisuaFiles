# VisuaFiles
 VisuaFiles scans your files and organizes them in file groups that allows you to easily see
 exactly what type of files make up your drive or directory. VisuaFiles allow you to
 then view the files in each group (in sorted order from biggest size to smallest) and open
 them in file explorer or delete them.
 
 Files are organized in custom file groups based on how they are grouped on https://fileinfo.com.
 They can be viewed in these custom groups or viewed in groups based on the files extensions.
 Custom file groups are loaded from text files in the DATA folder and the user can add more 
 extensions to those lists or even create their own file groups.
