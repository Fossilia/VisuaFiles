# VisuaFiles

 VisuaFiles scans your files and organizes them in file groups that allows you to easily see
 exactly what type of files make up your drive or directory. VisuaFiles is unique since it organizes
 your files in custom file groups based on how they are grouped on https://fileinfo.com.
 They can be viewed in these custom groups or viewed in groups based on the files extensions.
 Custom file groups are loaded from text files in the DATA folder and the user can add more 
 extensions to those lists or even create their own file groups.
 
 #Usage
 Here are some basic instructions and screenshots on how to use VisuaFiles.

 ##Drive menu
 When you first load VisuaFiles, you will greeted with this screen showing info about your drives
 and allows you to scan one of them or scan a custom directory:

 ##Scan Summary
 Once your drive or directory of choice is done scanning, a scan summary will appear detailing information
 about the scan. The first line shows how many extensions in your drive/directory that were matched in the text 
 files in the DATA folder. Extensions not found will be found in the Other Files group. Also on this screen you 
 choose how you want to view your files, either organized by the custom file groups (1) or listed by extensions (2).
